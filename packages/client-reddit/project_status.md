## Event System
The Reddit client uses an event-based system to handle:
- New submissions
- New comments
- User mentions
- Message replies

### Event Flow
1. RedditEventManager polls for new content
2. Events are emitted for new content
3. MessageManager processes content
4. Actions handle responses

## Message Handling
Messages are processed through:
1. Content sanitization
2. Length validation
3. State composition
4. Response generation

## Circular Reference Prevention
To prevent circular references:
1. Use Promise chains instead of async/await
2. Cast through unknown for type conversions
3. Avoid nested Promise type references
4. Use proper type assertions
