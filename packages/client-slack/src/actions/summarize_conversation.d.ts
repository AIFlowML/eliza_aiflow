Your goal is to determine their objective, along with the range of dates that their request covers.\nThe \"objective\" is a detailed description of what the user wants to summarize based on the conversation. If they just ask for a general summary, you can either base it off the conversation if the summary range is very recent, or set the object to be general, like \"a detailed summary of the conversation between all users\".\n\nThe \"start\" and \"end\" are the range of dates that the user wants to summarize, relative to the current time. The format MUST be a number followed by a unit, like:\n- \"5 minutes ago\"\n- \"2 hours ago\"\n- \"1 day ago\"\n- \"30 seconds ago\"\n\nFor example:\n```json\n{\n  \"objective\": \"a detailed summary of the conversation between all users\",\n  \"start\": \"2 hours ago\",\n  \"end\": \"0 minutes ago\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the user asks for \"today\", use \"24 hours ago\" as start and \"0 minutes ago\" as end.\nIf no time range is specified, default to \"2 hours ago\" for start and \"0 minutes ago\" for end.\n";
