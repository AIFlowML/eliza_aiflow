# Memory Loading Implementation Notes

## Overview

The memory loading system is designed to take data from various file formats (JSON, TXT, PDF) and load them into Eliza's memory system using the PostgreSQL adapter.

## Implementation Details

### Memory Types

The system supports different types of memories:
- `text`: Plain text memories
- `conversation`: Chat/dialogue memories
- `document`: Document-based memories
- `image`: Image-related memories
- `relationship`: Relationship data
- `goal`: Goal-related memories

### Database Operations

1. Memory Creation
   - Uses the `createMemory` method from PostgresDatabaseAdapter
   - Handles batch operations for efficiency
   - Includes error handling and rollback capabilities

2. Embedding Generation
   - Generates embeddings for text content using OpenAI or local models
   - Stores embeddings in the vector database for semantic search

3. Relationship Management
   - Creates relationships between memories when relevant
   - Updates existing relationships as needed

## Performance Considerations

1. Batch Processing
   - Process files in chunks to manage memory usage
   - Use connection pooling for database operations
   - Implement retry logic for failed operations

2. Error Handling
   - Validate input data before processing
   - Log errors with sufficient context
   - Provide clear error messages to users

## Future Improvements

1. Support for more file formats
2. Parallel processing for large datasets
3. Enhanced metadata extraction
4. Better duplicate detection
5. Improved error recovery
