# Project Status

## Current Status
- ✅ Multi-agent index.ts created and configured
- ✅ Test infrastructure migrated from Vitest to Jest
- ✅ Memory manager tests implemented and working
- ✅ SQLite adapter configuration fixed
- ✅ Package dependencies updated
- ✅ Test files setup with real database adapters

## Outstanding Issues
1. TypeScript Configuration
   - Project references need to be properly set up between packages
   - Need to ensure consistent module resolution across packages

2. Test Suite Stability
   - Need to verify CacheManager initialization in tests
   - Ensure proper database adapter type handling
   - Validate memory manager interface implementation

## Next Steps
1. Development Focus
   - Work exclusively in /Users/ilessio/dev-agents/eliza_aiflow/multiagents directory
   - Use eliza_doc_small.txt as primary reference for debugging and development
   - Complete multi-agent system implementation by end of day (MANDATORY)

2. Test Suite Completion
   - Complete implementation of multi-agent.test.ts
   - Finish single-agent.test.ts scenarios
   - Add comprehensive orchestrator tests
   - Ensure proper cleanup between tests

3. Code Review
   - Complete thorough review of index.ts
   - Verify all imports and dependencies
   - Check for any missing functionality
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Validate configuration options

4. Documentation
   - Add detailed comments to test files
   - Document test setup and configuration
   - Update debugging guidelines

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Created multi-agent index.ts with AgentOrchestrator
- ✅ Migrated test framework from Vitest to Jest
- ✅ Set up test files with real SQLite adapter
- ✅ Implemented proper test setup configuration
- ✅ Added CacheManager with DbCacheAdapter
- ✅ Updated TypeScript configurations for core and adapter packages
- ✅ Removed mock database adapter in favor of real implementations
- ✅ Added comprehensive debug flow protocol to .cursorrules
